# CLIMBER-X Earth System Model

CLIMBER-X is a comprehensive fast Earth System Model, designed to simulate the evolution of the Earth system on time scales ranging from decades to glacial-interglacial cycles. It includes the following components:
- semi-empirical statistical-dynamical Atmosphere model (SESAM)
- 3-D frictional-geostrophic Ocean model (GOLDSTEIN): [Edwards and Marsh 2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-004-0508-8)
- Ocean Carbon Cycle model (HAMOCC): [Ilyina et al. 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012MS000178)
- Sea Ice model (SISIM)
- Land model (PALADYN): [Willeit and Ganopolski 2016](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3817/2016/)
- Ice Sheet model (Yelmo): [Yelmo](https://github.com/palma-ice/yelmo)
- Ice Sheet model (SICOPOLIS): [SICOPOLIS](http://www.sicopolis.net/)
- Viscoelastic Lithosphere and Mantle model (VILMA)

The model is described in detail in the following articles:

While most components of CLIMBER-X are available as open-source code, the access to some parts (ocean biogeochemistry model HAMOCC and solid Earth model Vilma) are still restricted, but the goal is to eventually publish the whole model as open source.
